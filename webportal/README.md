# Webportal

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.4.

## Configure development environment

To build the webportal, execute `npm install` to retrieve all dependencies for the project.
Afterwards, the development server and the build of the project is available.

The backend service is assumed to be running on `http://localhost:8080`.
This configuration can be changed in the `src/environments/environment.ts` file for development.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
